# Product Studio User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to Product Studio! This guide will help you make the most of this decision-support tool.

## Philosophy

Product Studio is built on a core principle: **Good decisions come from structured thinking, not automated recommendations.**

We provide frameworks to help you:
- Ask better questions
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Identify blind spots
- Think systematically

We do NOT:
- Tell you what to do
- Rank or score options automatically
- Predict outcomes
- Make decisions for you

## The Five Frameworks

### 1. Problem Framing

**When to use:** At the start of any significant decision or when you feel stuck

**Purpose:** Ensure you're solving the right problem before investing resources

**How to use:**
1. Describe the problem as you currently see it
2. Identify who is affected (users, teams, stakeholders)
3. Articulate the impact (metrics, experience, technical)
4. Explain why this matters now (timing, urgency)
5. List your key assumptions
6. Review the generated structured statement
7. Ask yourself: "Am I solving the right problem?"

**Common pitfall:** Jumping to solutions before fully understanding the problem

**Pro tip:** Come back to problem framing after gathering more information - your understanding will evolve

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

**When to use:** When addressing recurring issues or understanding why something happened

**Purpose:** Move beyond symptoms to address underlying causes

**How to use:**
1. Describe what you're observing (the symptom)
2. Use the 5 Whys technique:
   - Why #1: Why is this happening?
   - Why #2: Why does that happen?
   - Continue until you reach a root cause
3. List contributing factors beyond the main chain
4. Review the analysis
5. Ask: "Would fixing this prevent the symptom from recurring?"

**Common pitfall:** Stopping too early or jumping to blame people instead of systems

**Pro tip:** If your final "why" is "because someone made a mistake," dig deeper into what allowed that mistake

### 3. Risk Management

**When to use:** Before committing to a decision or approach

**Purpose:** Make informed decisions with eyes wide open to potential risks

**How to use:**
1. State the decision you're considering
2. Brainstorm risks across four dimensions:
   - Technical: scalability, debt, integration
   - Business: competition, revenue, churn
   - User Experience: adoption, learning curve, accessibility
   - Organizational: resources, capacity, alignment
3. For each risk, consider:
   - How likely is it?
   - What would the impact be?
   - Can you mitigate it?
4. Develop mitigation strategies
5. Review and decide if risks are acceptable

**Common pitfall:** Only considering technical risks or risks you can easily mitigate

**Pro tip:** Share your risk assessment with stakeholders - they may spot risks you missed

### 4. Tradeoff Evaluation

**When to use:** When choosing between multiple viable options

**Purpose:** Systematically compare options and understand what you're trading off

**How to use:**
1. Describe the decision context
2. Define your options (A and B):
   - Give each a clear name
   - Describe what it entails
3. Compare them across dimensions:
   - Time to implement
   - Resource requirements
   - User impact
   - Technical complexity
4. Articulate the key tradeoffs in your own words
5. Review the comparison
6. Ask: "What am I optimizing for? What am I willing to sacrifice?"

**Common pitfall:** Trying to find an option with no downsides (they all have tradeoffs)

**Pro tip:** Consider whether you can test either option on a smaller scale before full commitment

---

### 5. Responsible Next Steps Guidance

**When to use:** After analysis, before taking action

**Purpose:** Plan next steps appropriate to your confidence level and available information

**How to use:**
1. Summarize your current situation
2. State your proposed direction
3. Honestly assess your confidence level:
   - Low: Need much more information
   - Medium: Some unknowns remain
   - High: Well understood
4. Identify information gaps
5. List validation opportunities (research, prototypes, data)
6. Identify stakeholders to consult
7. Review recommended approach
8. Plan next steps that match your confidence level

**Common pitfall:** Moving at the same speed regardless of confidence and risk

**Pro tip:** If confidence is low, focus on learning rather than building

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to use all five frameworks for every decision?**
A: No! Use whichever frameworks are relevant to your situation. Some decisions only need one or two.

**Q: Can I use this for small decisions?**
A: Yes, though it's most valuable for significant, ambiguous decisions. Use your judgment.

**Q: What if I don't know the answer to a question?**
A: That's valuable information! It tells you what you need to learn before deciding.

**Q: Can I save my analysis?**
A: Currently, you need to copy the output. A future version may include save/export functionality.

**Q: Is this data stored anywhere?**
A: No. Everything happens in your browser. Your inputs never leave your machine.

**Q: Why doesn't this give me recommendations?**
A: Because good product decisions require context, judgment, and expertise that no tool can provide. We help you think; you make the decision.
